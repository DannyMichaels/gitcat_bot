# Daniel's DiscordBot
This is just something I'm trying for fun before starting to learn backend development in my coding bootcamp journey. It's a very simple bot but making it has helped me be more comfortable with node.js.

## Commands:

Commands start with the prefix '!'. <br />
For example: !ping ('!' is the prefix, 'ping' is the command)

- !member (get the member role)
- !github (bot provides a link to this github)
- !youtube (bot gives me a plug and advertises my youtube channel, lol.)
- !ping (moderator only command, bot will reply with 'pong!')

### Changelogs:

- October 17, 2020 11AM : Initialzied bot and repo, gave it some basic commands.
- October 17, 2020 8:25PM : Added basic reaction functionality.
